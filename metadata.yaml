description: Novel about London slum life in the 1870s and 1880s. Raw, Unsentimental,
  offering little comfort, viewing the working classes as condemned to a life in hell
  via industrialization, a life from which there is no hope of escape. It is one man's
  mordant vision--shaped by bitter personal experience of poverty--of the quality
  of life endured by a variety of characters in the nether world. With Zolaesque intensity
  and relentlessness, Gissing lays bare the economic forces which determine the aspirations
  and expectations of those born to a life of labour. This is a tale of intrigue,
  as rapacious schemers try to wrest a fortune out of a mysterious old man who has
  returned to their midst, and of thwarted love.
